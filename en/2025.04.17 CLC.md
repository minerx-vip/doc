## One-Click Mining Flight Sheet

#### 1. Description

The official setup supports two modes: SOLO mining and Pool mining.

- SOLO Mining
  - Coins mined are stored locally and need to be imported into a wallet manually.
- Pool Mining
  - Coins mined are stored in the pool and need to be withdrawn to a personal wallet.



#### 2. Flight Sheet - SOLO Mode

> Coins mined are saved locally and must be imported into a wallet. A guide will be provided later.
>
> Mined coins are stored in `.coin` files located in the `/opt/clc_miner/rewards/` directory. If no files exist in this folder, no block has been mined yet.
>
> When creating a wallet in MinerX, the wallet address can be set arbitrarily, as the mined coins are saved locally.

    }
}
```



#### 3. Flight Sheet - Official Pool

> Note: When creating a wallet in MinerX, the wallet address is not your real wallet address. Instead, it is a custom string that must be unique to avoid conflicts.
>
> This string acts as your account in the pool and is used to log in and withdraw coins.
>
> Keep it secret to avoid someone guessing and stealing your coins.

> Note: Change `report_user` to your pool account name, used to view hash rate.
>
> Choose a unique custom string that does not duplicate any other.

```ini
mode="pool"
report_server="https://clc.ix.tc:3000"
report_user="report_user_neirong"
```

```json

    "flightName": "CLC",
