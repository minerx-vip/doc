## Connect to Miner via SSH

There are two ways to easily connect to the miner's SSH for management.



#### Method 1: Intranet Connection

Click the SSH icon in the last column of the miner list page.

**Advantages**: Direct connection to the miner via the internal network address, no external network traffic required, smoother operation.

**Disadvantages**: The machine you're operating from must be in the same local network as the miner, and you need to manually enter the username and password.

#### Method 2: Internet Connection

- 1. Click the Web Shell button on the miner details page (Figure 1).
- 2. Wait for the connection to succeed (Figure 2), then click the `sshx` button.
- 3. Copy the address behind "Link" in the popup window and paste it into the browser (Figure 3).

**Advantages**: Can be connected anytime and anywhere, not restricted by network limitations.

**Disadvantages**: Requires external network traffic, less smooth operation than the first method.
